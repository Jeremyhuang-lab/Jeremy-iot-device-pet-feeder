1.Product name
==
Pet feeder

2.Product creative reasons
==
Clothes are designed to resist the cold, and then they are given more connotations.
Fire is used for heating and deterring beasts before it is used for energy.
Tools are for better product acquisition, and then they evolve into machines.
The evolution of human civilization is not laziness, but human beings have been pursuing their own comfort.

With people’s increasing material life needs and yearning for a better life, many people of all walks of life and all ages have begun to raise pets, but contemporary workers usually work at 007, and they really don’t have time to take care of their pets. In the last year of the epidemic, many people were unable to feed their pets at work due to the lockdown of the city. Therefore, smart pet feeders came into being.
