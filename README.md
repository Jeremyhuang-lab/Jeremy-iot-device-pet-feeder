Pet feeder

2.Product creative reasons
==
Clothes are designed to resist the cold, and then they are given more connotations.
Fire is used for heating and deterring beasts before it is used for energy.
Tools are for better product acquisition, and then they evolve into machines.
The evolution of human civilization is not laziness, but human beings have been pursuing their own comfort.

With people’s increasing material life needs and yearning for a better life, many people of all walks of life and all ages have begun to raise pets, but contemporary workers usually work at 007, and they really don’t have time to take care of their pets. In the last year of the epidemic, many people were unable to feed their pets at work due to the lockdown of the city. Therefore, smart pet feeders came into being.

衣服是为了抵御寒冷，然后才被赋予更多内涵。
火是为了取暖和阻吓野兽，然后才被用于能源。
工具是为了更好获得产品，然后才进化为机器。
人类文明的进化不是懒惰，是人类一直在追求自己的舒适。

随着人们日益增长的物质生活需求和对美好生活的向往，目前许多各行各业，各个年龄阶层的人都开始养起来宠物，但是当代打工人平时工作007，实在没有时间照顾小宠物，而且经过去年疫情事件，许多人因封城居家隔离，不能前往工作地喂养宠物，因此，智能宠物喂食器应运而生。
